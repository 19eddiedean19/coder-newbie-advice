## About

This repository of files has been created to be a useful source of information for people interested in learning to code. 

It's starting as a series of mark down files, but the plan is to turn it into a website.

The current information I've collated includes:
* Meetup groups where you can learn to code for free (especially in London)
* Free Bootcamps
* Free online resources 


## Contribute

Feel like something's missing? Please open a PR to contribute. 

I've added organisations and resources that I'm aware of, but unfortunately I don't know of everything out there. Especially meetup groups outside of London. 

Please help to share any knowledge you have by growing this repository.
