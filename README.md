## About

This repository of files has been created to be a useful source of information for people interested in learning to code. 
You don't have to spend a lot of money to learn to code. There are many free resources and groups that can help you learn to code. Don't let money stop you.

It's starting as a series of mark down files, but the plan is to turn it into a website.

The current information I've collated includes:
* Meetup groups where you can learn to code for free
* Free Bootcamps
* Free online resources for learning to code & tech tests, interviews & cvs


## Contribute

Feel like something's missing? Please open a PR to contribute. 

I've added organisations and resources that I'm aware of, but unfortunately I don't know of everything out there. Especially meetup groups outside of London. 

Please help to share any knowledge you have by growing this repository.
